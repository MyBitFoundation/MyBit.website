      The MyBit Network is powered by the MyBit Token (MYB). It’s used for everything from executing specific functions with our SDKs to accessing features of applications. Basically, all apps built on MyBit (including MyBitGO) use MYB to function. The token’s also used to fund the growth of the network through MyBit Ventures and other developer reward programmes.

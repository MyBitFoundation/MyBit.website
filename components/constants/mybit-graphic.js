      The MyBit Network is powered by the MyBit Token (MYB).
      MYB is used for everything from executing specific functions with our SDKs
      to accessing features of applications. Basically, all apps built on MyBit
      (including MyBitGO) use MYB to function. The token is also used to fund
      the growth of the network through MyBit Ventures and other developer reward programmes.

        <li>
          Burn tokens to use the MyBit SDK and applications. Much like
          gas on the Ethereum network, MyBit Tokens power all applications
          on the network. The key difference is tokens are burnt instead of going to miners.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stake tokens for asset collateral.
          Users can lock their MYB, adding a layer of security for
          investors on the MyBitGo investment platform.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stake tokens for DAX.
          Users can stake their MYB tokens, in exchange for DAX tokens which offer a
          50% discount on trading fees when using the MYDAX exchange.
        </li>
        <li>
          Access layers on dApps.
          Many dApps built using MyBit’s technology stack require a one time burning of
          MYB to unlock the application.
        </li>
        <li>
          Investing in funds.
          Users can lock MYB tokens to help fund promising dApps through MyBit Ventures.
          Successful applications can then join the DDF to rapidly scale development.
        </li>
